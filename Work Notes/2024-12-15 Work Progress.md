## Current Graph Organization
- Main tools are now linked in Tools Hub
- Need to ensure consistent cross-linking between docs
- Some tools could use automation script expansion

## Next Steps
1. Document systemctl and related tools (systemd, poweroff)
2. Create network tools documentation (iperf)
3. Develop essential commands and scripts documentation
4. Enhance GPU monitoring documentation
5. Create automation frameworks that integrate multiple tools

## Notes
- Focusing on automation-friendly output formats
- Including Prometheus/monitoring integration where applicable
- Adding troubleshooting sections to all docs
- Maintaining consistent structure across documentation
