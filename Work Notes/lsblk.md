# lsblk: Comprehensive Guide and Usage

## What is lsblk?

lsblk (List Block Devices) is a command-line utility for Linux systems that provides detailed information about all available block devices. It's particularly useful for viewing the disk layout, partitions, and their mount points in a tree-like structure.

Key features:
- Displays block devices in a tree format
- Shows details like size, type, mountpoint, and more
- Can display additional information like filesystem type and UUID
- Supports various output formats

## Basic Usage

To list all block devices:
```bash
lsblk
```

This command displays a tree-like structure of all block devices, including disks, partitions, and logical volumes.

## Common Options

1. Show all information:
   ```bash
   lsblk -a
   ```

2. Display full device paths:
   ```bash
   lsblk -f
   ```

3. Show disk topology:
   ```bash
   lsblk -t
   ```

4. Display specific columns:
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
   ```

5. Show filesystem information:
   ```bash
   lsblk -f
   ```

## Advanced Usage

1. Display in JSON format:
   ```bash
   lsblk -J
   ```

2. Show devices that are not mounted:
   ```bash
   lsblk -l -o NAME,TYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | awk '$4=="" && $2!="part"'
   ```

3. Display SCSI devices only:
   ```bash
   lsblk -S
   ```

4. Show device permissions and owners:
   ```bash
   lsblk -m
   ```

5. Display device serial numbers (if available):
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,SERIAL
   ```

## HPC-Specific Usage

In HPC environments, lsblk is particularly useful for:

1. Storage System Verification
   Create a script to verify the expected storage configuration:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # verify_storage.sh
   expected_devices=("sda" "sdb" "nvme0n1")
   
   for device in "${expected_devices[@]}"; do
     if lsblk | grep -q "$device"; then
       echo "$device found"
     else
       echo "WARNING: $device not found!"
     fi
   done
   ```

2. Parallel File System Checks
   For systems using parallel file systems like Lustre:
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT | grep lustre
   ```

3. RAID Configuration Verification
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,ROTA | grep raid
   ```

4. NVMe Device Management
   List all NVMe devices:
   ```bash
   lsblk -d -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,TRAN | grep nvme
   ```

5. Storage Performance Categorization
   Identify rotational (HDD) vs non-rotational (SSD) devices:
   ```bash
   lsblk -d -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,ROTA
   ```

6. Automated Storage Reporting
   Create a comprehensive storage report:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Storage Configuration Report"
   echo "============================"
   echo "Block Devices:"
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
   echo "\nFilesystem Information:"
   lsblk -f
   echo "\nDisk Topology:"
   lsblk -t
   ```

## Best Practices for HPC Use

1. Regular Audits: Use lsblk in scripts for regular storage configuration audits.

2. Integration with Monitoring: Incorporate lsblk output into your monitoring systems for storage oversight.

3. Performance Tuning: Use lsblk to identify device types (SSD vs HDD) for performance tuning.

4. Capacity Planning: Regularly check available space on devices to aid in capacity planning.

5. Troubleshooting: Use lsblk as a first step in storage-related troubleshooting.

6. Documentation: Keep lsblk outputs as part of system documentation, especially after changes.

## Interpreting Output

- NAME: Device or partition name
- MAJ:MIN: Major and minor device numbers
- RM: Removable device flag (0 for no, 1 for yes)
- SIZE: Size of the device
- RO: Read-only flag
- TYPE: Device type (disk, part for partition, lvm for logical volumes)
- MOUNTPOINT: Where the device is mounted

## Tips and Tricks

1. Combine with grep for quick searches:
   ```bash
   lsblk | grep sda
   ```

2. Use with watch for real-time monitoring:
   ```bash
   watch lsblk
   ```

3. Pipe to less for easier navigation of large outputs:
   ```bash
   lsblk -a | less
   ```

4. Combine with other tools like `df` for comprehensive storage information:
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT && echo "" && df -h
   ```

Remember, while lsblk is powerful for viewing block device information, it should be used alongside other tools like `fdisk`, `parted`, and `mount` for a complete storage management toolkit in HPC environments.


# Integrating lsblk with System Monitoring Tools in HPC Environments

## 1. Prometheus Integration

Prometheus is a popular monitoring system and time series database.

### Step 1: Create a Custom Exporter

1. Create a Python script (`storage_exporter.py`):

```python
import subprocess
import time
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Gauge

# Define metrics
DISK_SIZE = Gauge('disk_size_bytes', 'Disk size in bytes', ['device'])
DISK_TYPE = Gauge('disk_type', 'Disk type (0: HDD, 1: SSD)', ['device'])

def get_disk_info():
    cmd = "lsblk -bdno NAME,SIZE,ROTA"
    output = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True).decode()
    for line in output.strip().split('\n'):
        name, size, rota = line.split()
        DISK_SIZE.labels(device=name).set(int(size))
        DISK_TYPE.labels(device=name).set(0 if int(rota) else 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    start_http_server(8000)
    while True:
        get_disk_info()
        time.sleep(60)
```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install prometheus_client
   ```

3. Run the exporter:
   ```
   python storage_exporter.py
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Prometheus

Add to `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'storage'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

## 2. Nagios/Icinga Integration

For Nagios or Icinga, create a custom check script.

1. Create `check_storage.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define thresholds (in GB)
WARNING_THRESHOLD=100
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=50

# Get available space of root partition
ROOT_SPACE=$(lsblk -bno SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | awk '$2=="/" {print $1/1024/1024/1024}')

if (( $(echo "$ROOT_SPACE < $CRITICAL_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "CRITICAL - Root partition has only ${ROOT_SPACE}GB free"
    exit 2
elif (( $(echo "$ROOT_SPACE < $WARNING_THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "WARNING - Root partition has only ${ROOT_SPACE}GB free"
    exit 1
else
    echo "OK - Root partition has ${ROOT_SPACE}GB free"
    exit 0
fi
```

2. Add to Nagios/Icinga configuration:

```
define command {
    command_name    check_storage
    command_line    $USER1$/check_storage.sh
}

define service {
    use                 generic-service
    host_name           your_host
    service_description Root Partition Space
    check_command       check_storage
}
```

## 3. Grafana Dashboard

Combine lsblk data with other metrics in a Grafana dashboard.

1. Use Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.

2. Create a dashboard with panels like:
   - Disk Size Distribution
   - SSD vs HDD Usage
   - Disk Utilization Over Time

Example Query for Disk Size Panel:
```
sum by (device) (disk_size_bytes)
```

## 4. ELK Stack Integration

Use Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log analysis and visualization.

1. Create a Logstash configuration (`storage.conf`):

```
input {
  exec {
    command => "lsblk -bno NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT"
    interval => 300
  }
}

filter {
  csv {
    columns => ["name", "size", "type", "mountpoint"]
    separator => " "
  }
  mutate {
    convert => { "size" => "integer" }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    index => "storage-metrics-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

2. Configure Kibana to visualize this data.

## 5. Custom Monitoring Script

Create a comprehensive monitoring script that combines lsblk with other tools.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Storage and System Monitor Report"
echo "================================="

echo "\nDisk Layout:"
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT

echo "\nDisk Usage:"
df -h

echo "\nI/O Statistics:"
iostat -x 1 5

echo "\nTop Processes by I/O:"
iotop -b -n 1 | head -n 10

echo "\nOpen Files:"
lsof | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 10
```

## 6. Integration with Cluster Management Tools

For HPC environments using cluster management software like Slurm:

1. Create a Slurm prolog script to check storage before job execution:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# storage_check.sh

MIN_SPACE=100G  # Minimum required space

AVAIL_SPACE=$(lsblk -bno NAME,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | awk '$3=="/scratch" {print $2}')
MIN_SPACE_BYTES=$(numfmt --from=iec $MIN_SPACE)

if [ "$AVAIL_SPACE" -lt "$MIN_SPACE_BYTES" ]; then
    echo "Insufficient space on /scratch. Job cancelled."
    exit 1
fi
```

2. Add to Slurm configuration:

```
Prolog=/path/to/storage_check.sh
```

## Best Practices for Integration

1. Data Consistency: Ensure consistent units and naming conventions across different tools.
2. Frequency Balance: Adjust data collection frequency to balance between accuracy and system load.
3. Alerting: Set up alerts for critical storage events across all integrated systems.
4. Historical Data: Maintain historical storage data for trend analysis and capacity planning.
5. Access Control: Implement proper access controls for storage monitoring data.
6. Documentation: Keep thorough documentation of your integrated monitoring setup.

Remember, the key to effective integration is to provide a unified view of your storage infrastructure that aligns with your specific HPC environment needs and operational practices.
