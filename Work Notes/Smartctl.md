Smartctl is a command-line utility used to monitor and control SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) attributes of hard drives and solid-state drives. It's part of the smartmontools package available on most Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

Here's a brief overview of how to use smartctl:

1. Basic health check:
   ```
   smartctl -H /dev/sdX
   ```
   Replace /dev/sdX with your drive's device name (e.g., /dev/sda).

2. View SMART attributes:
   ```
   smartctl -a /dev/sdX
   ```
   This displays detailed information about the drive, including SMART attributes.

3. Run a short self-test:
   ```
   smartctl -t short /dev/sdX
   ```

4. Run a long self-test:
   ```
   smartctl -t long /dev/sdX
   ```

5. View self-test results:
   ```
   smartctl -l selftest /dev/sdX
   ```

6. Enable SMART on a drive:
   ```
   smartctl -s on /dev/sdX
   ```

These are some basic uses of smartctl. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more advanced examples?
