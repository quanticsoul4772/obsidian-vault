Here's a list of best practices for installing, updating, and maintaining NVIDIA drivers in Ubuntu:

  

1. Determine the appropriate driver:

  - Use the ubuntu-drivers command to see recommended drivers:

   ```

   ubuntu-drivers devices

   ```

  - Check NVIDIA's website for the latest driver compatible with your GPU.

  

2. Installation methods:

  a. Ubuntu's built-in Additional Drivers tool (recommended for beginners):

   - Open "Software & Updates"

   - Go to the "Additional Drivers" tab

   - Select the recommended NVIDIA driver

   - Apply changes and reboot

  

  b. Ubuntu's command-line tool:

   ```

   sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

   ```

  

  c. NVIDIA's official .run file (for advanced users):

   - Download from NVIDIA's website

   - Stop the display manager: 

    

    sudo systemctl stop gdm (or lightdm)

    

   - Switch to a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F3)

   - Run the installer:

    ```

    sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-xxx.xx.run

    ```

  

3. Post-installation verification:

  - Check driver version:

   ```

   nvidia-smi

   ```

  - Verify OpenGL:

   ```

   glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"

   ```

  

4. Updating drivers:

  - For drivers installed via Ubuntu repositories:

   ```

   sudo apt update

   sudo apt upgrade

   ```

  - For manually installed drivers, repeat the installation process with the new driver version

  

5. Kernel updates:

  - If using repository drivers, they should automatically rebuild for new kernels

  - For manual installations, you may need to reinstall the driver after major kernel updates

  

6. Troubleshooting:

  - Keep old kernels installed for fallback

  - Use nomodeset kernel parameter if you encounter boot issues

  - Be prepared to use the command line if GUI fails to start

  

7. Maintenance best practices:

  - Regularly check for driver updates (every few months)

  - Monitor GPU performance and temperatures using nvidia-smi

  - Keep your system updated:

   ```

   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

   ```

  

8. CUDA toolkit (if needed):

  - Install CUDA separately from the driver

  - Use CUDA runfile for installation if you need a specific version

  

9. Secure Boot:

  - If Secure Boot is enabled, you'll need to sign the NVIDIA modules

  - Consider using repository drivers which handle this automatically

  

10. Uninstallation (if needed):

  - For repository drivers:

   ```

   sudo apt purge nvidia*

   ```

  - For manual installations:

   ```

   sudo nvidia-uninstall

   ```

  

11. Multiple GPUs:

  - Ensure proper power and cooling

  - Use nvidia-smi to monitor all GPUs

  - Consider using nvidia-prime for laptops with hybrid graphics

  

12. Wayland vs X11:

  - NVIDIA drivers work best with X11

  - If using Wayland, be prepared for potential issues

  

13. Backup:

  - Always backup important data before major driver changes

  - Consider creating a system snapshot if possible

  

14. Testing:

  - After installation or updates, test GPU-intensive applications

  - Run benchmarks to ensure performance is as expected

  

15. Documentation:

  - Keep notes on which driver versions work best for your system

  - Document any specific tweaks or configurations you've made

  

Remember, stability is often more important than having the absolute latest driver version, especially in production environments. Always test new drivers thoroughly before deploying them in critical systems.
