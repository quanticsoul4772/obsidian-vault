# Process Management Tools Guide

## Overview
This guide connects and documents tools used for process management in Linux systems, providing a comprehensive overview of how these tools work together.

## Core Process Management Tools

### Interactive Process Viewers
- [[Tools - htop]] - Interactive process viewer and manager
  * Real-time process monitoring
  * Interactive process management
  * System resource visualization

### Process Control
- [[Tools - nohup]] - Run processes immune to hangups
  * Background process management
  * Process persistence
  * Signal handling

### Memory Management
- [[Tools - mprune]] - Memory management utility
  * Memory optimization
  * Cache management
  * Memory leak prevention

### System Load Testing
- [[Tools - stress-ng]] - System stress testing tool
  * CPU stress testing
  * Memory stress testing
  * I/O stress testing

## Integration with System Services
- [[Tools - systemctl]] - System service management
  * Service control
  * Service monitoring
  * Boot management

## Monitoring and Diagnostics
- [[Tools - Performance Monitoring Scripts]]
  * Process monitoring
  * Resource usage tracking
  * Performance metrics

## Common Workflows

### System Monitoring
1. Use htop for real-time monitoring
2. Set up Performance Monitoring Scripts for logging
3. Monitor system services with systemctl

### Process Management
1. Launch persistent processes with nohup
2. Manage memory with mprune
3. Monitor process health with htop

### Performance Testing
1. Use stress-ng for load testing
2. Monitor results with htop
3. Track system service status with systemctl

## Troubleshooting Guide
- Process hangs: Use htop to identify and kill
- Memory issues: Use mprune for optimization
- Service problems: Check systemctl status
- System stress: Monitor with htop during stress-ng tests

## Best Practices
- Regular process monitoring
- Proactive memory management
- Service health checks
- Load testing in staging environments
