# Strategies for Correlating Temperature Trends with System Performance Metrics in HPC

## 1. Data Collection

### Temperature Data
- Use lm-sensors or IPMI for CPU and system temperatures
- For GPUs, use nvidia-smi or equivalent tools

### Performance Metrics
- CPU utilization (from /proc/stat or tools like sar)
- Memory usage (from /proc/meminfo or tools like free)
- I/O operations (using iostat)
- Network throughput (using iftop or netstat)
- Job completion times (from job scheduler logs)
- FLOPS or specific benchmark scores

## 2. Data Integration

1. Time Synchronization
   - Ensure all data points have accurate timestamps
   - Use NTP (Network Time Protocol) across your cluster

2. Central Data Repository
   - Use a time-series database like InfluxDB or Prometheus
   - Example InfluxDB data structure:
     ```
     measurement: node_metrics
     tags: node_id, metric_type
     fields: temperature, cpu_util, mem_usage, job_id
     timestamp
     ```

3. Data Collection Script
   ```python
   from influxdb import InfluxDBClient
   import psutil, time

   client = InfluxDBClient('localhost', 8086, 'root', 'root', 'hpc_metrics')

   while True:
       cpu_temp = psutil.sensors_temperatures()['coretemp'][0].current
       cpu_util = psutil.cpu_percent()
       mem_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent

       json_body = [
           {
               "measurement": "node_metrics",
               "tags": {
                   "node_id": "node001",
               },
               "fields": {
                   "temperature": cpu_temp,
                   "cpu_utilization": cpu_util,
                   "memory_usage": mem_usage
               }
           }
       ]
       client.write_points(json_body)
       time.sleep(60)  # Collect data every minute
   ```

## 3. Analysis Techniques

1. Time Series Analysis
   - Use moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations
   - Identify trends and seasonal patterns in both temperature and performance data

2. Correlation Analysis
   - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between temperature and various performance metrics
   - Example using pandas:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     from influxdb import InfluxDBClient

     client = InfluxDBClient('localhost', 8086, 'root', 'root', 'hpc_metrics')
     query = 'SELECT temperature, cpu_utilization FROM node_metrics WHERE time > now() - 7d'
     result = client.query(query)

     df = pd.DataFrame(result.get_points())
     correlation = df['temperature'].corr(df['cpu_utilization'])
     print(f"Correlation between temperature and CPU utilization: {correlation}")
     ```

3. Regression Analysis
   - Use linear regression to model the relationship between temperature and performance metrics
   - Example using scikit-learn:
     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     import numpy as np

     X = df['temperature'].values.reshape(-1, 1)
     y = df['cpu_utilization'].values

     model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
     print(f"R-squared: {model.score(X, y)}")
     print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]}")
     ```

4. Lag Analysis
   - Investigate if temperature changes lead or lag performance changes
   - Use cross-correlation functions to identify time offsets

5. Threshold Analysis
   - Identify critical temperature thresholds where performance starts to degrade
   - Example:
     ```python
     performance_drop = df[df['temperature'] > df['temperature'].quantile(0.95)]['cpu_utilization'].mean()
     normal_performance = df[df['temperature'] <= df['temperature'].quantile(0.95)]['cpu_utilization'].mean()
     print(f"Performance drop at high temperatures: {normal_performance - performance_drop}")
     ```

## 4. Visualization Techniques

1. Scatter Plots
   - Plot temperature vs. various performance metrics
   - Use color coding for additional dimensions (e.g., time of day)

2. Heat Maps
   - Create 2D heat maps with temperature on one axis, performance metric on another, and color representing frequency or another metric

3. Time Series Plots
   - Plot temperature and performance metrics on the same time axis
   - Use dual Y-axes for different scales

4. Interactive Dashboards
   - Use tools like Grafana to create interactive dashboards
   - Allow drilling down into specific time periods or nodes

## 5. Practical Applications

1. Thermal Throttling Detection
   - Identify instances where high temperatures lead to CPU frequency reduction
   - Correlate with performance drops in compute-intensive tasks

2. Cooling System Efficiency
   - Analyze the relationship between ambient temperature, CPU temperature, and cooling power consumption
   - Optimize cooling strategies based on workload patterns

3. Workload Optimization
   - Identify types of workloads that cause higher temperature increases
   - Adjust job scheduling to balance thermal load across the cluster

4. Predictive Maintenance
   - Use temperature trends to predict potential hardware failures
   - Schedule maintenance during periods of expected lower performance impact

5. Resource Allocation
   - Adjust resource allocation based on temperature-performance correlations
   - Example: Reduce job allocation to nodes showing poor performance at high temperatures

## 6. Challenges and Considerations

1. Multivariate Nature
   - Temperature is just one factor affecting performance
   - Consider other variables like workload type, system age, etc.

2. Non-Linear Relationships
   - The relationship between temperature and performance may not be linear
   - Explore non-linear regression techniques if needed

3. Temporal Aspects
   - Account for time-based effects (e.g., warm-up periods, thermal inertia)

4. System Heterogeneity
   - Different nodes or components may have different temperature-performance relationships
   - Analyze groups of similar hardware separately

5. Environmental Factors
   - Consider the impact of external factors like HVAC changes, seasonal variations

Remember, the goal is not just to collect data, but to derive actionable insights that can improve the efficiency, performance, and reliability of your HPC system.


# Integrating Temperature and Performance Analysis with Job Scheduling in HPC

## 1. Data Collection and Integration

### Temperature and Performance Data
- Collect data as described in previous responses (using lm-sensors, IPMI, etc.)
- Store in a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus)

### Job Scheduler Data
- Most HPC job schedulers (e.g., Slurm, PBS, LSF) provide APIs or log files
- Collect job-related data: job ID, user, allocated nodes, start/end times, resource usage

### Integration Point
- Create a central data repository that combines:
  - Temperature data
  - Performance metrics
  - Job scheduler data

## 2. Job Scheduler Integration Approaches

### A. Prolog and Epilog Scripts
Most job schedulers support prolog (pre-job) and epilog (post-job) scripts.

1. Prolog Script Example (Slurm):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # prolog.sh
   job_id=$SLURM_JOB_ID
   nodes=$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
   
   # Record starting temperatures
   for node in $nodes; do
     ssh $node "sensors | grep 'Core'" | \
     awk -v job=$job_id '{print "job_temp,job_id="job",node="node",event=start temp="$3}' | \
     influx -database 'hpc_metrics'
   done
   ```

2. Epilog Script Example:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # epilog.sh
   job_id=$SLURM_JOB_ID
   nodes=$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
   
   # Record ending temperatures
   for node in $nodes; do
     ssh $node "sensors | grep 'Core'" | \
     awk -v job=$job_id '{print "job_temp,job_id="job",node="node",event=end temp="$3}' | \
     influx -database 'hpc_metrics'
   done
   
   # Analyze job impact
   python /path/to/analyze_job_impact.py $job_id
   ```

3. Configure in slurm.conf:
   ```
   Prolog=/path/to/prolog.sh
   Epilog=/path/to/epilog.sh
   ```

### B. Scheduler Plugins
Develop custom plugins for your job scheduler to make scheduling decisions based on temperature and performance data.

Example concept for a Slurm plugin:

```c
// temp_aware_select.c
#include <slurm/slurm_errno.h>
#include <src/slurmctld/slurmctld.h>

// Function to check node temperature
int check_node_temp(char* node_name) {
    // Implement temperature check logic
    // Return 1 if temperature is acceptable, 0 otherwise
}

// Plugin initialization
int init(void) {
    return SLURM_SUCCESS;
}

// Node selection logic
int select_nodes(job_desc_msg_t *job_desc, List node_list) {
    ListIterator iter = list_iterator_create(node_list);
    node_info_t *node_ptr;
    
    while ((node_ptr = list_next(iter))) {
        if (!check_node_temp(node_ptr->name)) {
            // Remove node from consideration if temperature is too high
            list_remove(iter);
        }
    }
    
    list_iterator_destroy(iter);
    return SLURM_SUCCESS;
}

// Plugin API definition
const char plugin_name[] = "Temperature-aware node selection plugin";
const char plugin_type[] = "select/temp_aware";
const uint32_t plugin_version = SLURM_VERSION_NUMBER;
```

Compile and install this plugin, then configure Slurm to use it.

### C. External Scheduler Helper
Create an external program that communicates with the job scheduler to influence decisions.

1. Develop a helper program:
   ```python
   # scheduler_helper.py
   import subprocess
   from influxdb import InfluxDBClient
   
   def get_node_temperatures():
       client = InfluxDBClient('localhost', 8086, database='hpc_metrics')
       result = client.query('SELECT last("temperature") FROM node_temps GROUP BY node')
       return {item['node']: item['last'] for item in result.get_points()}
   
   def update_node_features():
       temps = get_node_temperatures()
       for node, temp in temps.items():
           if temp > 80:  # Example threshold
               subprocess.run(['scontrol', 'update', f'nodename={node}', 'features=HOT'])
           else:
               subprocess.run(['scontrol', 'update', f'nodename={node}', 'features=COOL'])
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       update_node_features()
   ```

2. Run this helper periodically (e.g., via cron)

3. Update job submission to use these features:
   ```bash
   sbatch --constraint=COOL myjob.sh
   ```

## 3. Implementing Intelligent Scheduling Policies

1. Temperature-Aware Placement
   - Avoid scheduling jobs on nodes with high temperatures
   - Distribute heat-generating jobs across the cluster

2. Performance-Based Scheduling
   - Allocate jobs to nodes that have shown better performance for similar workloads

3. Predictive Scheduling
   - Use historical data to predict temperature and performance impacts of jobs
   - Schedule jobs to minimize thermal emergencies and maximize performance

4. Dynamic Resource Allocation
   - Adjust CPU frequencies or job resource allocations based on current temperatures

5. Maintenance Windows
   - Automatically schedule maintenance for nodes showing performance degradation at certain temperatures

## 4. Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement

1. Job Performance Analysis
   - After each job, analyze its impact on system temperatures and performance
   - Use this data to refine scheduling algorithms

2. Regular Policy Reviews
   - Periodically review the effectiveness of scheduling policies
   - Adjust thresholds and algorithms based on long-term trends

3. User Feedback Integration
   - Provide mechanisms for users to report job performance issues
   - Correlate user feedback with temperature and performance data

## 5. Challenges and Considerations

1. Balancing Priorities
   - Trade-offs between system health, job throughput, and user satisfaction

2. System Heterogeneity
   - Different nodes may have different thermal characteristics
   - Scheduling policies should account for hardware variations

3. Workload Diversity
   - Different types of jobs have different thermal impacts
   - Develop categorization systems for workloads based on their thermal profile

4. Real-Time Performance
   - Ensure that temperature-aware scheduling doesn't significantly increase job queue times

5. User Education
   - Inform users about temperature-aware policies and how they might affect job prioritization

Remember, the goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between your temperature/performance monitoring systems and your job scheduler, leading to a more efficient, reliable, and performant HPC environment.
