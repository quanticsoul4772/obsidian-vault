Here are several approaches you can use to efficiently research existing apps similar to DreamVision. Here's a strategy you can follow:

1. Use App Store Search Tools:
   - For iOS: Use the App Store on an iOS device or iTunes on a computer.
   - For Android: Use the Google Play Store website or app.

2. Employ Relevant Keywords:
   Use combinations of these terms in your searches:
   - "Dream journal"
   - "Dream diary"
   - "AI art generator"
   - "Dream interpretation"
   - "Dream visualization"
   - "Dream analysis"

3. Utilize Third-Party App Intelligence Platforms:
   While these often require paid subscriptions, some offer limited free features:
   - App Annie (now called data.ai)
   - Sensor Tower
   - AppTweak

4. Explore App Store Optimization (ASO) Tools:
   These can help you find apps based on keywords:
   - TheTool
   - AppRadar
   - MobileAction

5. Use General Search Engines:
   Google or Bing searches like "best dream journal apps" or "AI art generation apps" can lead to curated lists and reviews.

6. Check Tech and App Review Websites:
   Sites like TechCrunch, The Verge, or specialized app review blogs often cover innovative apps.

7. Explore Social Media and Forums:
   Platforms like Reddit (e.g., r/apps, r/dreams) or Twitter can be sources for discovering apps and user opinions.

To start, I'd recommend this approach:

1. Open the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
2. Search for "dream journal" and note the top 5-10 results.
3. Repeat the search with "AI art generator" and again note the top results.
4. Try combining terms, like "dream visualization" or "dream art generator".

As you do this, keep a list of the most relevant apps you find. For each app, note:
- App name
- Developer
- Brief description
- Key features
- User rating
- Number of reviews
